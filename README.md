# Traffic Light Queue Simulator
This project simulates a traffic junction with 4 roads (A, B, C, D) and multiple lanes using queues. 
It handles:
1. Normal traffic conditions (vehicles served fairly from each lane)
2. Priority lane conditions (AL2 lane served first if more than 10 vehicles are waiting)
